First of all, you must download vial software <b><a href="https://get.vial.today/download/" target="_blank">here</a></b> and setting your computer input language to english international (in order to having latin characters able: á, é, í, ó, ú, ñ).

I'll recommend to you saving the "default" keymap configuration before start playing with all the options you have to customize your keyboard.

After saving the current layout (File -> Save current layout) you'll have a "backup" to restore any time you want. So now you're be able to start learning and making some changes on your corne.
